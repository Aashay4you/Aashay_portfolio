Made this using react typescript nextjs and framer

Due to some unknown reason the favicon icon is not able to show the particular change in some system.
DO USE THE IMAGE SRC CODE IN THE PUBLIC OR APP FOLDER TO CORRECT THE MISTAKE

Setup:
nodejs should be installed in system
install npm first using npm install npm --global // Updates the ‘CLI’ client
also install next using npm if showing next error in terminal
to run locally use npm run dev
then click on the host link
