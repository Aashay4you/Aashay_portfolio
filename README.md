# Aashay_portfolio (NOT DEPLOYED YET USING AWS DUE TO SOME TECHNICAL GLITCH IN ACCOUNT)
Made this using react typescript nextjs and framer

Due to some unknown reason the favicon icon is not able to show the particular change in some system.
DO USE THE IMAGE SRC CODE IN THE PUBLIC OR APP FOLDER TO CORRECT THE MISTAKE

Setup:
1) nodejs should be installed in system
2) install npm first using npm install npm --global // Updates the ‘CLI’ client
3) also install next using npm if showing 'next' is not recognized as an internal or external command
4) npm install next (HAVE TO INSTALL AS NEXT FOLDER IS HIDDEN AND CANNOT BE COMMITED TO MAIN BRANCH)
5)to run locally use npm run dev
6)then click on the host link
