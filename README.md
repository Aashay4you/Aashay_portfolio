# PLEASE READ   (Aashay_portfolio) NEXT@13.4.8
# DEPLOYED IN AWS :

Made this using react typescript nextjs and framer

Due to some unknown reason the favicon icon is not able to show the particular change in some system when deployed locally but on aws deployment showing no error.
DO USE THE IMAGE SRC CODE IN THE PUBLIC OR APP FOLDER TO CORRECT THE MISTAKE.

Setup to run in local:
1) nodejs should be installed in system
2) install npm first using npm install npm --global // Updates the ‘CLI’ client
3) also install next using npm if showing 'next' is not recognized as an internal or external command
4) npm install next@13.4.8 (INSTALL 13.4.8 VERSION AS OTHER VERSION MAKES SOME UNEXPECTED CHANGES AND DOESNT ALLOW FOR THE EXPERIENCE SECTION TO SHOW)
5) to run locally use npm run dev
6) then click on the host link
7) Contact me wont work until deployed in aws or heroku web service
