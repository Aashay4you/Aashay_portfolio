        Currently pursuing a degree in {" "}
        <span className="font-medium">CSE </span>, I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming and development. I enrolled in a a lot of coding courses including machine and dee learning and {" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect which causes challenges to the mind. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Tensorflow and App development(flutter)
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with Tailwind CSS and  Node.js. I am always looking forward to
        learn new development strategies for the websites. I am currently looking for {" "}
        <span className="font-medium">internship</span> as a software
        developer/web developer.
